My talk from [Functional JavaScript London](https://twitter.com/funjsldn) about [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).

- Check out the [Slugify.elm](slugify/Slugify.elm) example for input hooked up to output
- Check out the [GithubSearch.elm](github-search/GithubSearch.elm) example for something more involved
- The slideshow was written in Elm, check it out [Presentation.elm](slides/Presentation.elm)
- There's other, non-working, Elm code in the [examples](slides/examples) directory.
